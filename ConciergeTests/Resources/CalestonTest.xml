\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 Our group stopped off in the city of \cf2 Damera \cf1 for rest and supplies. \cf3 Gray \cf1 spent time getting a permit so he could bring the dead eagle into the city and eat it, against \cf3 Caleston's\cf1  protests. Unfortunately the carcass was too decayed and he was force to leave it at customs. The journey ahead needed a horse and carriage so \cf3 Kussandrick\cf1  and \cf3 Caleston\cf1  scouted out a promising barn that might hold the quarry inside. \cf3 Kussandrick\cf1  created a distraction by urinating and \cf3 Caleston \cf1 was able to successfully enter the barn undetected. We stole the horse and carriage, lit the barn on fire, escaped the city, and met up with \cf3 Gray \cf1 and \cf3 Gilbert\cf1 .\par
\par
Continuing on the journey to \cf4 Blinding Rock\cf1 ,\cf4  \cf1 we came across a damaged bridge and an overly enthusiastic engineer. We were forced to go kill a (troll?) and then convinced the workers to hoist us across with their crane. After setting up camp for the night we were set upon by bandits who tried to get the jump on the group. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 was able to escape the fight unscathed, but the rest were not so lucky.\fs24\par

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 We met up with \cf2 Filbin\cf1 ,\cf2  \cf1 who had helped us in our last battle. He took us to his hideout which turned out to be a very well finished cave system, and potentialy new base of operations. After so many nights on the road, a real be was all we needed for a good nights sleep. We headed out the bright and early the next morning to find the Group spreading lycanthropy. \cf3 Gilbert \cf1 used his \cf4 zone of truth \cf1 spell again, but nothing much was learned. Upon reaching our destination, we were set upon by a pack of werewolves and \cf3 Kussandrick \cf1 might have been infected. We were able to open a secret door by getting \cf3 Gray \cf1 to just break the mechanism. \par
\par
The door did not fully open so we had to crawl through a small tunnel. Inside the complex we fought off many a werebeast, in one hell of a fight. After looting we found \cf5\i Glasses of Seeing\i0  \cf1 and an \cf5\i Immovable Rod\cf1\i0 . The source was already taken so we had to travel to the city of \cf6 Aveburry \cf1 and find \cf2 Erwin \cf1 (female elf). To get her to trust us, we had to say we were with \cf2 Filbin \cf1 only in her company; and to tell her "\i remember stary night\i0 " and mention \cf7 Filbin's\cf1  name. The city is at least partially in favor of lycanthropy as a last ditch effort to save themselves, and the druids might know where source is. It was best that we didn't make it known we are trying to stop the werebeasts.  \cf6 Aveburry \cf1 is built in the trees with the South and West protected by walls. There are no houses on the ground and people must move from tree to tree, some trees are magic.  There is a herb shop called the \cf6 Spider's Grove \cf1 on east side of town. \cf2 Erwin \cf1 is likely in the \cf6 Treaty Retreat\cf1 . We encountered a half-elf named \cf2 Jeramy \cf1 doesn't speak elvish.\fs24\par

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 We were able to discover that the source might be in the town hall. \cf2 Fenissa \cf1 wants to distribute source around the city using the inhibitors (giant floating crystals). After smooth talking our way into the vaults, fighting some water elementals, and solving a puzzle we finally opened the door. We were told it is better to destroy rather than steal the Source, but it wasn't there. However, there was an inhibitor which we were able to destroy. After heading back up to the council chamber to meet \cf2 Erwin\cf1 , we arrived while \cf2 Fenissa \cf1 was in the middle of a speech\cf2  \cf1 whereupon we were attacked by werewolves. The party dealt with them, but \cf2 Fenissa \cf1 escaped to fight another day. We were, however, able to save \cf2 Grommash Frume\cf1  who informed us that the plan to infect the city with lycanthropy was something of a worst kept secret.\par
\par
After the fight, we explained ourselves to \cf2 Grommash \cf1 and were allowed to search \cf2 Finissa's \cf1 office. Inside we found a letter implicating \cf2 Silverpine \cf1 with the scheme, a reference to a meeting point outside the city, and a map of trade routes suggesting the location of their lair. Her and \cf2 Silverpine \cf1 were scheming together. We also noticed she has a lot of books on the fae wilds, and \cf2 Gromash Froom's\cf1  daughter is leader of \cf3 The Boiling Fist\cf1 , \cf2 Mondath \cf1 (They are not on the best of terms). We made haste for the meeting point, picking up \cf2 Filbin \cf1 along the way, and planned our attack. Quick work was made of the defenders and only \cf2 Finissa \cf1 and a guard were left alive. From our interigation we learned \cf2 Silverpine \cf1 in the second tower, and the source is some kind of fae artifact. The guard was left alive, \cf2 Finissa \cf1 executed, and our course was set for the first tower that is haunted by G; a spirit from the battle of the 4th incoursion, and not a fan of lycanthropy.\fs24\par

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 We pressed on, making it to the first tower and discovered it in ruins. After entering the abandoned building, we all jumped down a pit into a small underground lake (except \cf2 Kus\cf1 , who decided to take the hidden staircase) and found a small island with a treasure chest on it. Trying to take some gold caused the ghost to appear and we were forced to deal with him using the power of song. He granted us several silvered weapons and a special bow. We then trekked to the second tower, entered stealthfully, and killed the first person we saw blowing our cover. The fight was difficult, and \cf3 Silverpine \cf1 managed to escape (although is likely dead on the other side). We discovered a magical anomaly that absorbed items put into it.\par
\par
The battle concluded, we closed to the anomaly with the \cf4\i Immovable Rod \cf1\i0 and gathered some new weapons. \cf3 Erwin \cf1 decided to go back to \cf5 Aveburry\cf1 , and \cf3 Filbin \cf1 and the rest of us went to find the crashed meteorite. We reached the location and found the remains of a battle, with the meteor already looted. A clue was found on a dead \cf6 Cult of the Dragon \cf1 member that contained reference to a camp near the *** mountains. Despite \cf2 Caleston's\cf1  protests, the group set out for the camp. After an encounter with an unknown monster, being attacked by snakes, and finding an impaled family, we fought another epic battle. \fs24\par

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 We made our way back to the barn to interogate our hostage \cf2 Thelo\cf1 , who told us about their \cf3 hunting lodge \cf1 deep in the mountains. \cf4 Gray \cf1 did most of the work, and while this was going on \cf4 Caleston \cf1 found some winter gear for the trek through the mountains. Something attacked \cf4 Caleston \cf1 during the night and left a mark scratched into his chest, the same mark as the one on the children of the murdered family. We set off for the mountain pass and reached a fork in the road and went left, eventually coming accross a giant's cave. Backtracking to the fork there appeared a magic door in the cliffside, and uppon entering we stumbled into a warmly lit bar bussling with patrons. Each of us received a gift and we set off again. We finally reached the \cf3 hunting lodge\cf1  and after an intial stealthful approach our cover was blown and we had to fight our way through.\fs24\par

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs29 After finally breaking into the \cf2 hunting \cf1 lodge we immediately split up. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 went down to the basement and discovered two prisoners chained up in a dungeon. One prisoner was a monk named \cf3 Lafawnda \cf1 and the other was a dwarf named \cf4 ###\cf1 . Meanwhile \cf3 Gray \cf1 and \cf3 Kussandrick \cf1 started blindly charging through the mansion, placing the entire house an alert. We quickly dispatched two smaller groups of enemies that rushed in, but just then the \cf2 lodge \cf1 started shaking and all of the doors began locking. We forced our way into the main room and came face to face with an enormous group of enemies including the leader, a large black \cf4 dragonborn\cf1 . A drawn out battle ensued where our hero's journy nearly came to an end, if not for the quick thinking of \cf3 Gilbert \cf1 and the assistance of \cf3 Lafawnda\cf1 . With the last of the foes cut down and our heroes victorious, the \cf2 lodge \cf1 began shaking again . . . \par
\par
Just then a woman who claimed to be a maid made her way downstairs. She said we had really fucked up and a giant dragon was on its way to secure the lodge. We all hightailed it out, running back down the mountain and taking shelter in the giants cave. While we originally assumed the small bed was for a Dwarf, it was in fact for their "young adult" child. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 and \cf3 Gray \cf1 wanted to not tell him anything, but \cf3 Lafawnda \cf1 demanded we tell the truth. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 volunteered to tell the kid in the morning and \cf3 Lafawnda \cf1 forced \cf3 Gilbert \cf1 to stay and observe. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 tried to skirt the truth but \cf3 Gilbert \cf1 just blurted everything out, causing the giant to sprint out of the cave and run off. We met up with \cf4 Filbin \cf1 back at the farm house and began our journey back to \cf5 Blinding Rock\cf1 , while being hunted by a demon. \cf3 Caleston's\cf1  usually powerful wisdom failed him during the start of the trek and he was haunted by nightmares about a demonic presence. He came up with a plan to sleep during the day while being carried by \cf3 Gray\cf1 , and keep watch at night, negating the demons influence. After several days travel, the group finally reached \cf5 Blinding Rock \cf1 and were met at the entrance by some shockingly racist Drow and \cf3 Gray \cf1 opened his dumb mouth and claimed \cf3 Kussandrick \cf1 and \cf3 Caleston \cf1 were slaves. After debriefing with \cf6 Mondath Frume\cf1 , we took a shopping trip in the city and found an eccentric vendor with some interesting magical items. \cf3 Caleston \cf1 also met with a spider priest and learned of a way to help his demon problem if the party completed a task for her.\par
